# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

This application is a Progressive Web App, which means you can install it on your device just like a native app and even use it offline.

### How to Install the App

**On Desktop (using Chrome, Edge):**

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  Look for an **Install icon** in the address bar, usually on the right side. It might look like a computer screen with a downward arrow.
3.  Click the icon and then click "Install" in the prompt that appears.
4.  The app will now be available on your desktop or in your start menu.

**On Mobile (Android with Chrome):**

1.  Open the application website in your Chrome browser.
2.  Tap the **three-dot menu icon** in the top-right corner.
3.  From the menu, select **"Install app"** or **"Add to Home screen"**.
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to add the app to your home screen.

**On Mobile (iOS with Safari):**

1.  Open the application website in your Safari browser.
2.  Tap the **Share icon** (a square with an arrow pointing up) at the bottom of the screen.
3.  Scroll down and tap on **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4.  Confirm by tapping **"Add"** in the top-right corner.

Now you can launch the app directly from your home screen!
